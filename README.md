# GMT 458 - Web GIS: Personal Web Page Assignment

This repository hosts my personal web page, developed as part of the GMT 458 â€“ Web GIS assignment at Hacettepe University. The project aims to familiarize us students with core web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the OpenLayers library through a practical application.

## Project Overview

My personal web page serves as a dynamic and interactive online presence, showcasing my academic background, professional experiences, skills, and projects. It is built with a focus on responsive design and geographical data visualization using OpenLayers.

## Features and Objectives Met

This project successfully meets all the assignment objectives:

* **HTML**: The website is structured with **at least three separate HTML files** (`index.html`, `about.html`, `gtkmd.html`), ensuring organized content.
* **CSS**: The project features **CSS animations** on interactive elements (like button hovers) and displays **tabular information with images** using a modern card-based layout for education and experience sections.
* **OpenLayers (OL)**: An interactive map is integrated into the site, displaying custom point markers for various locations I have travelled to. The map uses satellite imagery as a base layer and dynamically shows place names on zoom.
* **Git Usage**: Version control was managed with **at least 3 commits on different days**, demonstrating a consistent development workflow.

## AI Usage

* **Specific Learning/Issue Resolution from AI**: I used AI primarily to solve CSS styling problems. This included assistance with creating a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes and troubleshooting complex selector issues to achieve the desired visual design.
* **Estimate of Total AI Usage**: Approximately 1.5 - 2 hours.
